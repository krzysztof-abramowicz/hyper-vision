# HyperVision 

HyperVision is a rendering engine designed for procedural modelling of architectural forms. The idea for this project came with my dream of creating virtual cityscapes for the sake of widely-understood coordination of urban life and public administration. HyperVision-based Web Services would be a digital reflection of most municipal processes leading to a fair transparent, democratic, Information Society.
