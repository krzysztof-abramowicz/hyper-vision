 HyperVision is a rendering engine designed for procedural modelling of architectural forms.
 The idea for this project came with my dream of creating virtual cityscapes for the sake of
 widely-understood coordination of urban life and public administration. HyperVision-based
 Web Services would be a digital reflection of most municipal processes leading to a fair
 transparent, democratic, Information Society.

 HyperVision is an attempt to create a base for a Service for Everything -- a HyperService.
 Such tool would integrate all city services and highly optimise their use through advanced
 scheduling known from the HTC world. It would also introduce a perfect load balancing, so
 the share of work. The HyperService could be the world-first solution for unemployment and
 equitable distribution of resources.

 HyperVision project tries to achieve its ambitious goals from the very beginning. It is an
 inter-disciplinary project based on knowledge of different fields and using tools of various
 kinds. The implementation relies on linear algebra, stereometry and formal grammars (Maths),
 imperative programming, scripting and parsing (Computer Science), building design, proportion
 and stylistic periods (Architecture). It also uses many programming languages, libraries and
 compiling tools to create the final executable:

   • C'99 programming language,
   • Perl scripting language,
   • GLSL shading language,
   • OpenGL 4.0 graphical library,
   • GTK+ user-interface library,
   • GLib Testig framework,
   • GNU Make building tool,
   • Wavefront OBJ format,
   • x86_64 assembly (SSE intrinsics).

 The project tries to be inventive and use the state-of-the-art technology for implementation.
 Unfortunately, this brings a handful of problems including scarce knowledge resources and the
 lack of appropriate tools and functionalities in existing code base ...or at least not such
 that would meet my vision of HyperVision :-) This fact results in several important milestones,
 whose attainment significantly comlicates my work:

   0. Implementation of my own SSE-enabled linear algebra library,
   1. Writing Makefile for separate compilation of interdependent modules,
   2. Using my own C preprocessor for code generation and embedding resources,
   3. Creating OpenGL widget for GTK+ (EGL-based OpenGL 4.0 context),
   4. Rendering 3D graphics with the new OpenGL 4.0 syntax,
   5. Inventing an XML-based procedural model description language.

 I also place a strong emphasis on documentation. You will find a lot of technical information
 in the ./doc subtree of the project's directory. I highly recommend to start from reading the
 SUMMARY file which is the documentation's index and a guide through the project.

 Wishing you a hyper-experience with the project,

 Krzysztof Abramowicz
