It is not uncommon to overstate software requirements nowadays. This may be due to various
shortcomings or intended purposes. Sometimes both reasons alternate forming a multi-layered
structure of false assumptions leading to serious overetimations. This file was created for
a reliable determination of requirements for the HyperVision project.

REQUIREMENTS

Programming language:
	Version: C'99 : ISO/IEC 9899:1999
	New features utilised:
		boolean type [common]
		variadic macros [output]
		type-generic math [matrix]
		inline functions [matrix]
		compound literals [matrix]
		restrict pointers [matrix]
	Comments:
		Most C'99 features enrich the matrix module which emphasizess the scientific nature
		of the project. The implementation reflects my experiences with "concurrent programming"
		course by Dr Clemens Grelck (C'99, vectorisation, restrict pointers).


Project building tool:
	Version: GNU Make 3.82
	New features utilised:
		'define' directive
		- 3.81 -
		'.DEFAULT_GOAL' special variable
		'lastword' function
		'info' function
		'and' function
		- 3.80 -
		'value' function
		'eval' function
	Comments:
		Most of the cutting-edge features are used to implement my proprietary solution for
		interdependent modules' compilation -- the 'discover' function. The modern syntax also
		allowed me to implement embedded unit test cases as 'self-test' pseudo target.
	Resources:
		My StackOverflow question (and answer) on separate compilation ('discover' function).

Scripting Language
	Version: Perl 5.6
	TO DO
